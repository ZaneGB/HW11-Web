                                                            Weather Project - 

The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis, 
we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities. After assembling the dataset, 
we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs. latitude. Factors we looked at included: temperature, 
cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. 

This web site provides the source data and visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations 
and descriptions of any trends and correlations witnessed. 

1)	As expected the weather becomes increasingly warmer as one approaches the equator (zero degrees latitude). 
	More interestingly, howver, is the fact that the southern hemisphere seems to be warmer this time of the year 
  than the northern hemisphere. This may be due to the tilt of the earth at the time the data was gathered. 

2)	From our random sampling of world cities the highest temperatures can be observed between -25 and +25 degrees latitude. 
	Although the data obtained does not disprove the theory that temperatures peak at the equator it does cast aspersions on the hypothesis.
  A more robust analysis would include average annual temperatures rather than the highest temperature recorded on a particular day.

3)	The temperatures of cities in the northern hemisphere (positive latitudes) are more widely dispersed (0 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit) 
	than those in the southern hemisphere (negative latitudes), which tend to cluster together more densely 
  at points between 40 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit.

4)	There seems to be no correlation between latitude and measures of cloudiness, wind speed, or humidity.

5)	Water covers a vast portion of Earth. That is why we did not obtain any data points further south than -57 degrees latitude.
